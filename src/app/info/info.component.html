  <h1>Our Story!</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>
    Our story starts back in fourth grade at Vanstory Hills Elementary school.
    Meghan and I were in the same class with our teacher Mrs. Mund (figure 1). I
    don't recall much from that time, but I do have one strong memory. One day,
    Mrs. Mund showed us how our pupils tightened when exposed to light and
    dilated when in darkness. She told certain rows to turn around and face the
    person behind them. As everyone was shifting, Mrs. Mund went over to the
    light switch. She told everyone to get close and stare at each other's eyes.
    I was in the last row of the class, so the girl in front of me turned
    around. Mrs. Mund proceeded to count down, and when she turned off the
    lights, we watched our partner's pupils dilate. Many years from that day,
    Meghan and I went through my yearbook and came across those third and
    fourth-grade pictures. I asked her if she remembered Mrs. Mund doing that
    demonstration, and she told me she did. She then told me that she was the
    girl that turned around and gazed into my eyes. She remembers it vividly
    because I was apparently her fourth-grade crush. Huh. I knew that Beiber
    hair worked‚Ä¶

    After fourth grade, Meghan and I never were near one another. Her family
    moved to Grays Creek (20 minutes outside Fayetteville), and I stayed in
    town. We had always known of one another but never communicated. After many
    heartbreaks and dumb assignments, we were both approaching graduation.
    Around March 2019, our senior year, I looked through Instagram and found
    Meghan. She was (and still is) HOT, and I knew I had to try my luck. I
    waited until late that night to reach out to her because I assumed she would
    be mindlessly scrolling through Instagram. Around 8 pm, I sent her a snap. I
    was staring at my phone, waiting for her to open it. I finally received the
    notification that she had opened it. I sat there and waited ‚Ä¶ and waited ‚Ä¶
    and waited. She never replied. I turned off my phone and continued my
    Breaking Bad episode on Netflix. Women.

    TWO MONTHS LATER ‚Ä¶ I had just gotten back to the house from school. I went
    up into my room and caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I. Looked.
    Good. And I was damn sure going to let everyone see it. I threw my mirror on
    the ground, rolled up my sleeves, yelled at Bandit to come to me, made him
    lay down, and flexed. I took a picture and posted it on my Instagram story
    (figure 2). As I was scrolling through the list of people who viewed my
    story, I saw Meghan's name pop up. I scoffed and went on with my day. Later
    that same day, I was in the gym working out when I heard my phone go off. I
    glanced over and saw ‚ÄúMeghan üíì from Snapchat.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh my god, oh my god, OH MY
    GOD!‚Äù I exclaimed in a girly voice, ‚Äúshe ‚Ä¶ replied?‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    That night started the beginning of our relationship. Had I not posted that
    cocky picture of me flexing, she probably would not have ever reached out to
    me. Are your eyes watering? Mine too.
